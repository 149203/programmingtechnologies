;[[Ellipsis]] (as three periods–not one special character)
* [[MATLAB]]: The ellipsis token need not be the last characters on the line, but any following it will be ignored.<ref>[http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f0-5789.html Mathworks.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207151905/http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f0-5789.html |date=7 February 2010 }}</ref> (In essence, it begins a comment that extends ''through'' (i.e. including) the first subsequent newline character. Contrast this with an inline comment, which extends ''until'' the first subsequent newline.)

;[[Delimiter|Comma delimiter]] as last character of line
* Ruby (comment may follow delimiter)

* [[TeX]]: <code>%</code>

;Character position
* [[Fortran 77]]: A non-comment line is a continuation of the previous non-comment line if any non-space character appears in column 6.  Comment lines cannot be continued.
* [[COBOL]]: String constants may be continued by not ending the original string in a PICTURE clause with <code>'</code>, then inserting a <code>-</code> in column 7 (same position as the <code>*</code> for comment is used.)
* [[TUTOR (programming language)|TUTOR]]: Lines starting with a tab (after any indentation required by the context) continue the previous command.

;[End and Begin] using normal quotes
* [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] preprocessor: The string is ended normally and continues by starting with a quote on the next line.
